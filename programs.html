           <h2>Taekwondo Makes Children Smarter</h2>
           <p>Studies have shown that when children participate in physical activities such as Taekwondo at a young age, they tend to perform better in school than those who do not. The students who are physically active have higher IQs, perform better in social environments, receive better school grades, and have greater self esteem</p>
       </div>
   </div>
   <br>
   <h2>Fun and Exciting Learning Activities</h2>
  <p> Our children's program is designed to improve your child's fitness, teach them self defense, build self-discipline, learn self-control, increase self-confidence, and develop a proper sense of values and personality. Our exceptionally qualified and energetic instructors make getting in shape fun and exciting, and your child will look forward to coming to class.</p>
   <br>
   <br>
   <h2>Self-Discipline and Self-Esteem for Your Child</h2>
   <p>Taekwondo emphasizes moral development. Children learn respect for themselves and others, heighten concentration, and increase self-discipline and self-restraint. The self-discipline that develops as a result of learning and practicing Taekwondo carries over into other areas of the child's life. School grades often improve as your child learns to focus on objectives and work toward achievment. The self-discipline and self-respect which Taekwondo develops can provide your child with the skills and mindset necessary to resist peer pressure.</p>

        <p>Our JR Instructor Club challenges students in a new way.
            Not only will they work hard to perfect their techniques,forms, and self defense.
            They will have an opportunity to learn leadership skills and teamwork.
            Students will learn how to assist others during classes and promotion tests. 
            Additionally, under the supervision of other head instructors, they will learn to lead students and gain their respect. 
            This club also provides entry to our demonstration team where students are able to perform all they have learned and practiced in front of everyone during promotion tests.
